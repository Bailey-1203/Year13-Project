I you want to run this project you will need to open it in and integrated development Environment (IDE). 
there is a link to one below. If you want to open the project you need to select the "project" folder in your IDE.
Once opened you need to build the project by pressing the build button in the top menu of the IDE. then you can click run to run the project.
