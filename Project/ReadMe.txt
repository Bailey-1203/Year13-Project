Thank you for downloading this project!

I you want to run this project you will need to open it in and integrated development Environment (IDE). 
there is a link to one below. If you want to open the project you need to select the "project" folder in your IDE.
Once opened you need to build the project by pressing the build button in the top menu of the IDE. then you can click run to run the project.
I recommend you use the IDE linked below. this is the one i used and should work. i haven't tested other IDEs so they may require extra steps to run this project.

**IMPORTANT**
if you have trouble with the viewports rendering, go into the window class and change the width and height varibales to your screens widht and height in pixels.
these variables are assigned on line 52 and 53 of the window class.
